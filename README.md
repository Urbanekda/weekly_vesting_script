# Weekly Article Automation Script

This is a simple application that I created to help me automate a weekly-issued article with a set structure. Such articles are generated from [coinbrain.com](https://coinbrain.com/) using vesting data to inform users about top crypto unlocks each week. Each article features 4-5 projects and their major unlocks + a description.

## Frontend

The application contains a minimal frontend built in React which is used to fetch data through an API. Data from API are displayed within the structure of a finished article to save me as much time as possible.

## Backend

The backend part is written in Python using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) to serve the API. Upon request, the backend script scrapes vesting data of a selected project on [coinbrain.com](https://coinbrain.com/), cleans them, and formatsthem  for further usage.

## Example

[Here](https://coinbrain.com/blog/top-token-unlocks-of-the-week-dec-10th-16th-dimo-igu-0-kn-and-more) is an example of the article generated by this application.

## Note on Usability

The usability of this app is not very high and it is not intended for general use - it is only a tool that I created for myself to automate my work.
