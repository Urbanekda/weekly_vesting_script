            <h2>About Vesting and Token Unlocks</h2>
            <p>Both traditional finance and Web3 emerging projects often issue a share of tokens or stocks to their shareholders. These shareholder groups can for example be the developer team, founders, advisors, and so on.</p>
            <p>Tokens issued for shareholder groups and other use cases are often <a href="https://coinbrain.com/dictionary/token-lockups-in-crypto-explained-simply">not available immediately</a> after launch - instead, they are locked for a specified amount of time (<a href="https://coinbrain.com/dictionary/token-vesting-in-crypto-explained-simply" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vesting</a>) and released into circulation according to a predetermined schedule.</p>
            <p>Token Unlocks refer to the moments when these vested tokens become accessible or "unlocked."</p>
